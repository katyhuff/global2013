\frametitle{Cyder Diffusive Transport Sensitivity}
By evaluating the sensitivity to the reference 
diffusivity of the radionuclide transport in the MixedCell model, the 
the maximum releases due to isotopes treated as highly soluble and non-sorbing
were largely directly proportional to the relative diffusivity. 
This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:mixed_diff}
