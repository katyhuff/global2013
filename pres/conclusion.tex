\frametitle{Conclusion : Summary of Contributions}

This work has provided a software platform capable of bridging the gap between
fuel cycle simulation and repository performance analysis.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Conducted thermal transport sensitivity analyses. \cite{huff_numerical_2012, huff_benchmarking_2012}
  \item Conducted contaminant transport sensitivity analyses. \cite{huff_key_2012}
  \item \Cyder acheived integration with a fuel cycle simulator.
  \item Abstracted physical models of thermal and contaminant transport. \cite{huff_hydrologic_2013}
  \item Demonstrated dominant physics of those models in \Cyder, integrated 
  with \Cyclus. \cite{huff_dynamic_2013, huff_cyclus_2013}
  \item Published source code, documentation, and testing to facilitate 
  extension by external developers. \cite{huff_cyder_2013}
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Conclusion : Suggested Future Work}
  Further work could include
  \begin{itemize}
  \item cultivation of a developer community,
  \item more detailed benchmarking validation against sophisticated tools,
  \item comparison against experimental data, where available,
  \item demonstration of dynamic fuel cycle feedback sensitivities,
  \item additional physics (fracture models, biosphere models),
  \item and additional supporting data.
  \end{itemize}
