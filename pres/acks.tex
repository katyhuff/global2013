I am grateful to a number of extraordinary professors and colleagues at the 
Universities of Wisconsin and Chicago, as well as the national laboratories, 
who have inspired and encouraged me. My advisor, \textbf{Prof. Paul P.H. 
Wilson}, my laboratory mentor, \textbf{Dr. W. Mark Nutt}, and my committee 
members, \textbf{Prof. Jean M. Bahr, Prof. Michael L. Corradini, Prof. Douglass 
L. Henderson,} and \textbf{Prof. Robert J. Witt}, were especially supportive in 
this endeavor.

So too, my colleagues \textbf{Kyle M. Oliver, Matthew J. Gidden} and 
\textbf{Robert W. Carlsen} as well as summer student \textbf{Alexander T. Bara} have 
been essential collaborators and contributors.  All confidence I have in these 
results is owed to software practices inspired by my friends among The Hacker 
Within and Software Carpentry such as \textbf{Dr. Greg Wilson, Animal1, Wolfman, 
Slayer, Scopz, Nico,  BlackBeard, BlondeBeard,} and \textbf{RedBeard}. I owe my 
sanity to \textbf{Dr. Denia Djoki\'{c}}.
