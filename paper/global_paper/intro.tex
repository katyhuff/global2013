\section{Introduction}
The decay heat from nuclear material generates a signiﬁcant heat source within a 
repository.  This decay heat varies among fuel cycles, is transported diﬀerently 
in diﬀerent geologic media \cite{greenberg_applications_2011}, and aﬀects the resilience of engineered 
barrier choices \cite{andra_argile:_2005}. Since repository loading capacity is constrained by 
the resistence of such barriers to degradation, allowable decay heat burden 
varies among repository concepts. In order to distinguish among the performance 
of geologic media and Engineered Barrier System (EBS) choices in the context of 
the fuel cycle, a thermal capacity model has been included in a repository 
model designed for use with the \Cyclus fuel cycle simulator.
