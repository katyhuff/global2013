\section{Results}

Computational fuel cycle simulation tools capable of simulating heterogeneous spent fuel 
isotopics resulting from transition scenarios and alternative fuel cycles have 
previously lacked equally dynamic repository modeling options.  This work 
demonstrates that the Cyder generic repository model can inform fuel cycle 
metrics by providing just such a dynamic interface between waste management and fuel cycle technology decisions. 

The sensitivity analyses and validation efforts conducted in this work 
demonstrate the capability of the \Cyder tool to provide repository capacity and 
performance metrics in the context of dynamic fuel cycle feedback effects.
