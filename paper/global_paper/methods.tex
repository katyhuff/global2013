\section{Thermal Transport Analysis}

For dynamic thermal capacity analysis in Cyder, a transient model utilizes a 
linear approximation of heat based capacity quickly for each 
arbitrary waste stream offered to the repository. This relies on a thermal reference database of repository heat 
evolution curves covering the thermal coefficient range of the main geologies of 
interest and over a range of realistic waste package spacings.
