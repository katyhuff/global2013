  \frametitle{Need For an Integrated Repository Model}

  \input{systools_tab}
An integrated repository performance model enables the analysis of global fuel 
cycle metrics concerned with material routing, intermediate storage time, and 
repository performance. Post-processed analysis of these metrics can neglect 
feedback effects of geologic disposal capacity constraints and repository 
performance within the fuel cycle system.
