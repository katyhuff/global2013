\frametitle{Contributions from This Work}

This work has provided a platform capable of bridging the gap between fuel cycle 
simulation and repository performance analysis.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Conducted thermal transport sensitivity analyses. \cite{huff_numerical_2012, huff_benchmarking_2012}
  \item Conducted contaminant transport sensitivity analyses. \cite{huff_key_2012}
  \item \Cyder acheived integration with a fuel cycle simulator.
  \item Abstracted physical models of thermal and contaminant transport. \cite{huff_hydrologic_2013}
  \item Demonstrated dominant physics of those models in \Cyder, integrated 
  with \Cyclus. \cite{huff_dyanmic_2013, huff_cyclus_2013}
  \item Published source code, documentation, and testing to facilitate 
  extension by external developers. \cite{huff_cyder_2013}
  \end{itemize}
