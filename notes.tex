\section*{Title}

Introduce yourself.

\section*{Outline}



\section*{Top Level Fuel Cycle Simulators}

Nuclear fuel cycle simulation seeks to provide a system level overview of the 
movement of materials and other quantities of interest among facilities as 
nuclear energy is produced. Using fuel cycle simulation tools, the potential 
impact of novel technologies and policies can be approximated. 

\Cyclus is one such simulation tool. The \Cyder tool, which is the primary 
subject of this work, represents the geologic repository, here.

\section*{Future Fuel Cycle Options}

A number of potential nuclear fuel cycles are being considered domestically. 

\section*{Disposal Geology Options Considered}

A number of potential nuclear waste repository geologies are being considered 
domestically. 

\section*{Repository Components}



\section*{Need for an Integrated Repository Model}

An integrated repository performance model enables the analysis of global fuel
cycle metrics concerned with material routing, intermediate storage time, and
repository performance. Post-processed analysis of these metrics can neglect
feedback effects of geologic disposal capacity constraints and repository
performance within the fuel cycle system.


\section*{Outline}



\section*{Cyder Paradigm: Modularity}
A modular repository framework facilitates
\begin{itemize}
\item interchangable subcomponents
\item and simulations with varying levels of detail.
\end{itemize}
Integration with a fuel cycle simulator facilitates
\begin{itemize}
\item analysis of feedback effects upon the fuel cycle
\item and fuel cycle impacts on disposal system performance.
\end{itemize}
