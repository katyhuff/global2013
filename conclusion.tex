  \frametitle{Conclusion : Summary of Contributions}
  Created a platform for repository simulation that is
  \begin{itemize}
  \item integrated with a fuel cycle simulator,
  \item populated with physical models of thermal and radionuclide transport,
  \item and designed for extension by external developers.
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Conclusion : Suggested Future Work}
  Further work could include
  \begin{itemize}
  \item cultivation of a developer community,
  \item more detailed benchmarking validation against sophisticated tools,
  \item comparison against experimental data, where available,
  \item demonstration of dynamic fuel cycle feedback sensitivities,
  \item additional physics (fracture models, biosphere models),
  \item and additional supporting data.
  \end{itemize}
