\subsubsection{Reference Sorption Coefficient Sensitivity}

In the parametric analysis of \Cyder performance, it was shown that sorption 
sensitivity behavior closely matched that of the \gls{GDSM} sensitivity 
behaviors. Specifically, in Figure \ref{fig:kd_result}, increasing the retardation 
coefficient results in a smooth but dramatic turnover.
