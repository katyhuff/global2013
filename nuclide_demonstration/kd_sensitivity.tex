\subsubsection{Reference Sorption Coefficient Sensitivity}

In the parametric sensitivity analysis discussed in Section \ref{sec:sorption}, 
the expected inverse relationship between the retardation factor and resulting 
peak annual dose was found for all elements that were not assumed to be 
effectively infinitely soluble. In the low retardation coefficient cases, a 
regime is established in which the peak annual dose is entirely unaffected by 
changes in retardation coefficient. For large values of retardation 
coefficient, the sensitivity to small changes in the retardation coefficient 
increases dramatically. In that sensitive regime, the change in peak annual 
dose is inversely related to the retardation coefficient. Between these two 
regimes was a transition regime, in which the $K_d$ factor ranges from 
$1\times10^{-5}$ to $5\times10^{0} [-]$.

It is clear from Figures \ref{fig:KdSumFactor} and \ref{fig:KdSum} that 
for retardation coefficients greater than a threshold, the 
relationship between peak annual dose and retardation coefficient is a strong 
inverse one.
