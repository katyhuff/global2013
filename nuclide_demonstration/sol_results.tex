In the parametric analysis of \Cyder performance, it was shown that the 
solubility sensitivity behavior closely matched that of the \gls{GDSM} 
sensitivity behaviors. Specifically, in Figure \ref{fig:sol_result}, a sharp turnover 
is seen where the solubility limit exceeds the point at which it limits 
movement. For increased solubility limits, release remains constant.
