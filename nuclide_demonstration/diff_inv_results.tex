\subsubsection{Sensitivity to Difussivity and Inventory Cyder Results}
Most of the radionuclide transport models in \Cyder depend on the diffusive 
characteristics of the medium. By evaluating the sensitivity to the reference 
diffusivity of the radionuclide transport in the MixedCell model, the 
the maximum releases due to isotopes treated as highly soluble and non-sorbing
were largely directly proportional to the relative diffusivity. 
This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:mixed_diff}
