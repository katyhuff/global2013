\frametitle{Acknowledgements}
\indent I am grateful to a number of extraordinary professors and colleagues at the 
Universities of Wisconsin and Chicago, as well as the national laboratories, 
who have inspired and encouraged me. My advisor, 
\textbf{Prof.~Paul~P.H.~Wilson}, my laboratory metor \textbf{Dr. W.~Mark~Nutt} 
and my committee members, \textbf{Dr. Jean~M.~Bahr, Dr.  Michael~L.~Corradini, 
Dr. Douglass~L.~Henderson,} and \textbf{Dr. Robert~J.~Witt}, were especially 
supportive in this endeavor. 

\indent So too, my colleagues \textbf{Kyle~M.~Oliver, Matthew~J.~Gidden} and 
\textbf{Robert~W.~Carlsen} and summer student \textbf{Alexander~T.~Bara} have 
been essential collaborators and contributors.  All confidence I have in these 
results is owed to software practices inspired by my friends among The Hacker 
Within and Software Carpentry such as \textbf{Greg Wilson, Animal1, Wolfman, 
Slayer, Scopz, Nico,  BlackBeard, BlondeBeard,} and \textbf{RedBeard}. I owe my 
sanity to \textbf{Denia Djoki\'{c}}.
