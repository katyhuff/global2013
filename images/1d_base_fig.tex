\caption[$^{235}U$ residence 1 Dimensional PPM Model.]{
For the case in which transport through the waste form, waste package, and 
buffer are represented by quickly degrading Mixed Cell models and the Far Field 
is represented by the 1 Dimensional PPM model, material moves very slowly into 
the far field. These results demonstrate numerical difficulties in timestep 10, 
despite overloading this simulation with 1,000,000 initial kg per waste form.
